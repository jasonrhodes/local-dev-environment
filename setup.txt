~/vm/Vagrantfile
    - default file, uses all the default ~/vm manifests etc.
    - links the shared folder to the vhosts main folder

~/vhosts/project/Vagrantfile
    - custom for the project, if needed
    - should still point to the ~/vm/boxes/box
    - should still point to the ~/vm/modules
    - CAN still point to the default manifest, but why is it custom then?
